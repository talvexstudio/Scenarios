Make sure the document title matches the repository name so the browser tab always shows the repo name.
On the first git push make sure the default main branch is named main, do not change the name to anything else.
Give each git committed file or folder a unique description based on what the commit was about.
Create an initial README.md which gives a paragraph summary of the project as a whole as well as a features list, getting started, and controls at the first push commit to github.
The README.md header should always be the same as the repository name.
Update the README.md before each push commit to github to include any major new features, getting started, or controls, don't update the README.md with minor changes.
Don't keep track of git commits after each instruction or git diff cacheing, only check changes when merging and pushing to git.
Don't compact the context unless I tell you.
